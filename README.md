# BEXH

The BEXH is essentially 3 pieces of software: 
- A pseudo-centralized sports exchange, with a already set bet settling system.
- An easy to use app, mimicking the popular models of apps such as Robinhood for the stock market. 
- A secure backend for the app which allows for seamless connection between user to user, and user to exchange.

Let's break that last part down.

Our main component isn't meant to be our exhchange. It is the user. That is why, with this user-centric model, we plan to make our exchange accessible for professional bettors and casual ones. 

For pro bettors: 
- The whole purpose of this is to give all bettors a fairer shake. A 10 point vig on both sides is prepostorous, and is 10-100x more than margins faced in other industries. So if you see odds you like for a game you like on our exchange, you can enter that contract with the opposite party. You would be able to do this at a tenth of a vig price of standard books.
- Say however that you look at a game which you don't like the odds of. Well to avoid consistent studying of line changes, you can put a bet with a specific line, at a specific amount and if there is someone on the other side that makes the inconguous bet, then that bet will get executed automatically. If the bet is still hanging and you want to cancel it at any time, you can feel free to do so free of charge.
